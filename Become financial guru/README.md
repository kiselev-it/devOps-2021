# Task 2 - Become financial guru
```sh
# Download the database
curl -s https://yandex.ru/news/quotes/graph_2000.json > ./quotes.json
```
Now you have historical quotes for EUR/RUB pair since late November 2014. It's time to have some fun:
```sh
# let's get the mean value for the last 14 days and decide whether to buy Euros:
jq -r '.prices[][]' quotes.json | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+' | tail -n 14 | awk -v mean=0 '{mean+=$1} END {print mean/14}'
```
* try to understand the command above. Read something related to `jq` and `awk`.
* remove the `grep -oP '\d+\.\d+'` part, do the same thing without any pattern matching
* tell me which March the price was the least volatile since 2015? To do so you'll have to find the difference between MIN and MAX values for the period.

## Description of what my script does
task_2.sh - remove the `grep -oP '\d+\.\d+'` part, do the same thing without any pattern matching;
task_2.1.sh - tell me which March the price was the least volatile since 2015? To do so you'll have to find the difference between MIN and MAX values for the period.
